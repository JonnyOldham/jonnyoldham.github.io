        <br />
        <p id="aboutIntro">
          Below are some of my interests, and some thoughts about them.
        </p>

          <div class="tileText1">
            <h5>Orchestral and Choral Composition</h5>
            <p class="italic">
              'The final aim and reason of all music is nothing other than the
              glorification of God and the refreshment of the spirit'
            </p>

                I know what you're thinking. Indeed, J.S. Bach drew his
                livelihood from religious institutions. Yet, what richer
                wellspring of inspiration exists for a composer than the pursuit
                of glorifying one's conception of the transcendental? The idea
                retains purity precisely because it is scoped by the limits of
                one's imagination. Above my piano hangs a portrait of the
                preeminent architect of sound himself. This man harbored no
                desire for dominance, nor excessive financial gain but rather
                sought the ability to empower others see beyond their physical
                surround. A genuine servant of music, under whose watchful gaze
                I strive to meticulously imbue my scores with order, color, and
                emotion.

              <p class="aboutP">
                I think music embodies empathy in tangible form. While we
                perceive it through the filter of cultural baggage, it serves as
                a potent means of communication between souls. Film music, in
                particular, holds a special place for me. When skillfully
                composed, it weaves a narrative more potent than words or images
                alone ever could. The interplay of tension and resolution, the
                dynamic call and response - it transforms each piece into a
                captivating journey,
                <span style="font-style: italic;">there and back again</span>
                into realms of emotion. From the enchanting melodies of John
                Williams to the commanding textures of Zimmer, the whimsical
                instrumentation of John Powell to the rhythmic allure of
                Morricone - every great film composer leaves an indelible
                signature in the world. Their musical creations reflect a
                profound understanding of human connection. Perhaps one day
                people might remark, 'That sounds very Jonny Oldham,' and that
                there may exist a shared comprehension of what that entails
                drives my desire to contribute a unique voice to the tapestry of
                musical expression.

                Residing in 21st-century London, it's remarkably easy to lose
                one's self in the relentless pace of the urban hustle. The
                city's dynamic rhythm can be all-encompassing. Yet, taking a
                momentary step back unveils a captivating, slowly unfolding
                narrative of history embedded in the very foundation of our fair
                capital. Consider King's Cross, a microcosm where the intricate
                interplay of roads, railways, and waterways stands a testament
                to a palimpsest of centuries. Here, each era has been
                intricately woven into the urban fabric, creating a mosaic of
                time and development. Amidst the modern clamor, there lies a
                silent acknowledgment of the layers that constitute the city's
                essence. I think it's important to appreciate why a fence has
                been erected, before rushing to cut it down - a sentement
                captured wonderfully by the late Roger Scruton when he talks
                about
                <span style="font-style: italic;"
                  >'recognizing the value of what we have, the wisdom of the
                  past, and the need for gradual, organic change rather than
                  radical upheaval'.</span

                Personally, I've always been drawn to the solace found in
                seeking out quiet corners to walk, sit, and reflect. These
                moments often become an opportunity to conjure up melodies or
                simply let my thoughts meander. It's in the exploration of
                all-but-forgotten canals and waterways that I discover a
                reflection of my own stoic qualities. To me, this quest for
                insight is not about living in the past, but rather learning
                from it so that we not only avoid repeating the mistakes of
                history, but can innovate successfully armed with an
                illumination over how we achieved today's successes. In my view,
                parting with a week's wages to embody a sardine at Hyde Park's
                Winter Wonderland falls pale against an afternoon wandering our
                towpaths, contemplating the engineering of Brunel and simply
                observing ducks.

                Whether commanding the Space Marines to a decisive victory over
                the forces of Chaos, repelling the Uruk-Hai at Helm's Deep or
                guiding the British Empire to world domination, I've always been
                a keen gamer. My real passion though lies with turn-based and
                real-time strategy. Allocating resources, navigating technology
                upgrades and positioning combat units on a map is incredibly
                satisfying, if uninteresting to an observer. What we, as gamers,
                actually engage with however is more interesting. It's the
                pattern-recognition ability that wins the day I think. Being
                able to predict what a computer will do takes time. Trial and
                error. One can figure out what is likely to happen because
                computers are based on sets of rules. Predicting what a human
                will do.. requires skill.

                Ultimately, two human gamers are still operating within the
                confines of a rule-based system. There are a finite number of
                explicit unit types, boons, resources etc. but an infinite
                number of ways in which they might be employed. I've found that
                the real trick when facing an unknown human opponent is to force
                them to play
                <span style="font-style: italic;">your</span> game. Engage them
                in such a way that they are persistently on the back foot, like
                Rommel would. Emphasis on speed, initiative and surprise. This
                way, they have no time to plan and execute their own strategy,
                and are harrassed into withdrawal early, leaving the map's
                bounties to take. Lessons learned from previous encounters can
                be used to categorize one's enemy quickly, and base predictions
                upon this. If you can accurately assess
                <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span> your opponent
                thinks, you will understand
                <span style="font-style: italic;">what</span> he is likely to do
                next.

                I began working as a supporting artist during the covid-19
                pandemic, as an antedote to the spare time I suddenly found
                myself in posession of. I spent six months portraying a
                waist-gunner in the American 100th Bomb Group that fought out of
                east-anglia during the seocnd world war. What an incredible
                experience! From cheering on a pistol-initiated bike race,
                scrambling for cover during a night-time air-raid to bailing out
                of a crash-landed B-17 Flying Fortress and sprinting accross a
                field with cast members, it was, quite literally, an absolute
                blast. What an interesting lesson in group psychology too, given
                that a cohort of several hundred young men were chucked into a
                replica army base, wearing authentic uniform all day and
                pretending to be soldiers for months at a time. Place a weapon
                in a man's hand and watch the fire ignite in his belly. Did
                social hierarchies form? did personalities clash? were there
                dramatic swings of emotion felt by everyone? You bet.

                Since then, I've gone on to guard the king of England in several
                differet centuries, serve meringues to the Bridgerton family,
                fight in the battle of Waterloo, faithfully serve Captain
                Marvel, jeer at Victorian underground boxing matches and trade
                my wares in King's Landing, Westeros. In total, I have been a
                part of 43 different TV and film productions, ranging from a
                single day to recurring roles across many months. I have gained
                an accute appreciation of the delicacy of silver trays, the
                weight of chain-mail armour, the uncomfortability of medieval
                transportation and the acerbic taste of gunpowder. What better
                way is there to hone one's adapatability than starting a brand
                new job each day, somewhere completely different, with a whole
                new team. Give me a tray and I'm your footman. A starched
                collar, your aristocrat. A musket, your hero.
